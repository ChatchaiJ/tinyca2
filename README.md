tinyCA2 - version 0.7.5
========

This is a "fork" from debian sources.
* This repo contains shamelessly stolen debian patches (stolen-from-debian.patch). The debian patch has been modified to be used with arch linux.

* The package contains also 'fix-tinyca-paths.patch' and the modified PKGBUILD from arch aur repository. I'm not sure the author for fix-tinyca-paths.patch', but, the credits for the PKGBUILD must go to Marti Raudsepp <marti@juffo.org>

* My contribution to this package:
** New github repo from debian's source
** Cleaned the debian patches by removing debian specific stuff
** Modified PKGBUILD, so that it will retrive the source from my github repo.


Final words
=======
* Give credit where credit is due : my own contribution here is very limited. Please go through the source and give credits to contributors.  
* Tested on my arch installation. YMMV. It may eat your kitten, bite you dog or burn your cpu. So this package at your own risk ;-)
